	<h2>Upcoming Anime of Fall Season</h2>
	<P> The story of Jujutsu Kaisen is set in a world where Cursed Spirits feed on unsuspecting 
		humans and fragments of the legendary and feared demon Ryomen Sukuna have been lost and scattered about.
		Should any curse consume Sukuna's body parts, the power they gain could destroy the world as we know it. 
		Fortunately, there exists a mysterious school of Jujutsu Sorcerers who exist to protect the precarious 
		existence of the living from the supernatural! <a href = "www.wikipidia.com">Read More.</a>
	<br>
	Idly indulging in baseless paranormal activities with the Occult Club, 
	high schooler Yuuji Itadori spends his days at either the clubroom or the hospital,
	 where he visits his bedridden grandfather. However, this leisurely lifestyle 
	 soon takes a turn for the strange when he unknowingly encounters a cursed item. 
	 Triggering a chain of supernatural occurrences, Yuuji finds himself suddenly 
	 thrust into the world of Curses—dreadful beings formed from human malice and 
	 negativity—after swallowing the said item, revealed to be a finger belonging to 
	 the demon Sukuna Ryoumen, the "King of Curses."
